# SLDP Player's Storybook

The purpose of this Storybook is to showcase the different ways in which you can use and customize the SldpReactPlayer component in your React projects. You will find a collection of stories that demonstrate the functionality and configuration options of the component, as well as its visual appearance in different contexts.


We encourage you to experiment with the different props and options available, and to use this Storybook as a reference and a source of inspiration for your own projects.
